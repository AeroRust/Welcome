# What is `Aerospace`?

> Aerospace is the human effort in science, engineering, and business to fly in the atmosphere of Earth and surrounding space

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace)

# Why now?

Lately the Aerospace industry is picking up speed in comercialization and even faster and rapid development in the area, this is why we've created the AeroRust working group.

This Community and Working group is aiming to help push the Open-source community more into the growing Aerospace industry, by providing information, materials, tools, crates and etc. to hobyists and the industry.

# [The Rust programming language ðŸ¦€](https://rust-lang.org)

> A language empowering everyone
to build reliable and efficient software. 

We also aim to grow the [Rust programming language](https://rust-lang.org) community by this effort and set it as a leading technology in the area.

### You might be asking: Why Rust then?

The language is picking up speed and it's already making a change in other industries and inspiring changes in other languages and communities. Rust has many compelling features and benefits over other languages, however, it might not be the **only** language you might need to achieve your goals.

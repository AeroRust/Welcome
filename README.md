## A Rust ðŸ¦€ in Aerospace ðŸš€ Community & Working Group ðŸ™Œ

# Where to start



### The Community

An opened environemtn welcoming anyone interested in aerospace, robotics, programming, etc.

Our community resides on Discord, so make sure to join in there: https://discord.gg/Xd98GjuEhu

### Working group

Here you will find the people who are developing all the projects (from programming to educational) under the AeroRust organization.
A good starting point to get involved is to check out https://github.com/AeroRust/WorkingGroup/issues, where you can find or share new ideas, current projects and more.

Make sure to check out our Contact letter for companies, agencies and communities: https://github.com/AeroRust/WorkingGroup/issues/6

We have a number of participations in confereces, as well as talks which you can find here including links to watch them: https://github.com/AeroRust/WorkingGroup/issues/14


# What is `Aerospace`?

> Aerospace is the human effort in science, engineering, and business to fly in the atmosphere of Earth and surrounding space

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace)

# Why now?

Lately the Aerospace industry is picking up speed in comercialization and faster and rapid development in the area, this is why we've created the AeroRust. 

AeroRust is aiming to help push the Open-source community more into the growing Aerospace industry, by providing information, materials, tools, crates and etc. to hobyists and the industry.
There are 2 distict parts in organization:


# [The Rust programming language ðŸ¦€](https://rust-lang.org)

> A language empowering everyone
to build reliable and efficient software. 

We also aim to grow the [Rust programming language](https://rust-lang.org) community by this effort and set it as a leading technology in the area.

### You might be asking: Why Rust then?

The language is picking up speed and it's already making a change in other industries and inspiring changes in other languages and communities. Rust has many compelling features and benefits over other languages, however, it might not be the **only** language you might need to achieve your goals.

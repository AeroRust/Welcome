## Your launchpad to Aerospace ðŸš€ using Rust ðŸ¦€

The rapidly developing aerospace industry is picking up speed with faster and exponential development and comercialization, this is why we've created **AeroRust**.

**AeroRust** is aiming to help push the Open-source community more into the growing Aerospace industry, by providing information, materials, tools, crates and etc. to hobyists and the industry.
There are 2 distict parts in organization:

### The Community

An opened environment welcoming anyone interested in aerospace, robotics, programming, etc.

Our community resides on Discord, so make sure to come and say hi ðŸ‘‹ when you get there: https://discord.gg/6wFvsFWfnu

### The Working group

Here you will find the people who are developing all the projects (from programming to educational) under the AeroRust organization.
A good starting point to get involved is to check out https://github.com/AeroRust/WorkingGroup/issues, where you can find or share new ideas, current projects and more.

If you or your comapny is interested in this kind of technology, make sure to check out the Contact letter for companies, agencies and communities https://github.com/AeroRust/WorkingGroup/issues/6. We have layed out useful information if you're looking to adopt Rust and you can read about our aproach on how to grow it.

We have a number of conferece participations, as well as talks which you can find here including links where you can watch them: https://github.com/AeroRust/WorkingGroup/issues/14

# What is `Aerospace`?

> Aerospace is the human effort in science, engineering, and business to fly in the atmosphere of Earth and surrounding space

Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace)

# [The Rust programming language ðŸ¦€](https://rust-lang.org)

> A language empowering everyone
to build reliable and efficient software. 

We also aim to grow the [Rust programming language](https://rust-lang.org) community by this effort and set it as a leading technology in the area.

### You might be asking: Why Rust then?

The language is picking up speed and it's already making a change in other industries and inspiring changes in other languages and communities. Rust has many compelling features and benefits over other languages, however, it might not be the **only** language you might need to achieve your goals.

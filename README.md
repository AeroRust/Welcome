Welcome to the (Unofficial) Rust ðŸ¦€ + Aerospace ðŸš€ working group ðŸ™Œ

# What is `Aerospace`?

> Aerospace is the human effort in science, engineering, and business to fly in the atmosphere of Earth and surrounding space

# Why?

Lately the Aerospace industry is picking up speed in comercialization and even faster and rapid development in the area, this is why we've created the AeroRust working group.

This Working group is aiming to help push the Open-source community more into the growing Aerospace industry, by providing information, materials, tools, crates and etc. to hobyists and the industry.

# [The Rust programming language ðŸ¦€](rust-lang.org)

> A language empowering everyone
to build reliable and efficient software. 

We are also, of course, aiming to grow the [Rust programming language](rust-lang.org) community by this effort and set it as a leading technology in the area.

### You might be asking: Why Rust then?

The language is quite new, but it's already changing a lot of industries. Rust has many compealing features and benefits over other languages, but it's also might not the **only** language you need to choose and use.
